The maritime industry faces significant challenges in predicting how long a ship can remain afloat after critical incidents like hull breaches or flooding. Water ingress contributing to majority of these incidents, timely and accurate sink-time predictions are essential for improving safety and reducing losses. However, current systems lack real-time, data-driven predictions, leading to delays in evacuation, inefficient crisis management, and limited feedback for design improvements. This project aims to develop a deep learning model leveraging ship design, flooding rates, breach locations, and environmental factors to accurately predict sink times. By enhancing emergency protocols, preventative measures, and design optimization, this solution will transform maritime safety, reducing both human and material losses.
